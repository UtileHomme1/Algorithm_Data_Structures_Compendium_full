<!-- What are double ended queues in stl -->

<!-- Reference - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deque-cpp-stl/ -->

- are sequence containers with the feature of expansion and contraction on both the ends
- they are similar to vectors, but more efficient in case of insertion and deletion of elements at the end, and also the beginning

** Unlike vectors, contiguous storage allocation may not be guaranteed

 ** The functions are same as in vectors with an addition of push and pop operations for both front and back

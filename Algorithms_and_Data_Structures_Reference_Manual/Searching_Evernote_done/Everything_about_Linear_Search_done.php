Linear search involves comparing the element to be found with the each element
of an array

When the element is found , set flag = true else set flag=false
Depending on the value of flag in the end print the Message

<!-- Time Complexity -->

O(n) - because we are traversing all the elements in the worst case(i.e. when the element is in the end)

- Best case occurs when the element is found at the first position itself
Omega(1)

- Average case occurs when the element is found in the middle
Theta(n/2) = Theta(n)

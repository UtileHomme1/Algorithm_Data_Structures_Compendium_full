<!-- Problem -->
- We need to search an element and return its position in the unsorted list

<!-- Process -->
- Perform a linear search and return the index from the array
- Increment the index to get the exact position

<!-- Time Complexity -->

<!-- Worst Case -->
- It is possible that we might find the element at the end of the array
- In that case, we have to traverse the entire array

T(n) = O(n)
